# Real Time Notification Module

This module is developed for all the E-Commerce projects that are build with latest .Net Core framework and Sql Database(Its Optional). This will help you to track your order status on a more realistic map view which will help your Business Development team to explore the gray area.

# Why SignalR?
In earlier ASP.NET applications, user refreshes a web page to see new data or a page uses "long polling" to retrieve new data, i.e., when new data arrives to server it will not be directly transmitted to all clients or specific clients, for that the user has to refresh the page, and the page will be updated.

For example, you can go to cricinfo.com, there you can see a page is refreshed for 1 or 2 seconds and many times you see the score is not updated. In such situations there is the need of the new Microsoft API called "SignalR".

If you are a Software Developer and want to learn how I have created this project then please feel free to follow my short tutorial. This will guide you on how you can easily create projects on VSCode and how easy is to implement SignalR and combine its power with Google Map.
